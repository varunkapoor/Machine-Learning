Thia repository contains a project on Image segmentation using K-means clustering approach. This project is present under Dimensionality reduction folder. Apart from this project, the repository is a collection of small projects which I tried out using machine learning tools. Hence the name Machine Learning Tools.

IMP: The folders are named as the name of the machine learning approach used. To make it more clear I have provided the name of the project along with the ML technique used.

Contents:

* Multi variate Linear Regression : Profit Maximization prediction for an enterprise.

* Logistic Regression : Prediction of admission result based on previous exams result.

* Neural Network Representation : Handwritten digits recoginition using Forward Propagation.

* Neural Network Learning : Handwritten digits prediction using Backward Propagation.

* Regularization : Out flowing water prediction of a dam using the change of water level in a reservoir.

* Support Vector Machines : Drawing boundaries on 2D data sets.

* Dimensionality reduction : Image segmentation using K-means clusering.

* Recommender Systems : Anamolous behavior detection in server computers.
